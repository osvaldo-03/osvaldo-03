# 👋 Hi, I'm Osvaldo!

### About Me
- 🎂 **Age:** 20 years old
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** I'm pursuing an Associate of Science (AS) in Electrical Engineering at Valencia College. My goal is to transfer to the University of Central Florida (UCF) to complete my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Electrical Engineering.
- 💻 **Interests:** I have a deep passion for working with electronics, particularly Arduinos. I’ve created various projects in my spare time and am eager to expand my knowledge, especially in coding and hardware integration.
- 🚗 **Fun Fact:** When I'm not tinkering with Arduinos, I enjoy modifying cars. In the fall of 2022, I supercharged my car and have also worked on other automotive projects such as rebuilding engines, restoring bodywork, and redoing wiring. Besides cars, I have two dogs—Coco, a Lab mix, and Milo, a Chihuahua mix.

### Collaboration
- 🤝 **Looking to Collaborate On:** I’m excited to collaborate on Arduino and other electronics-based projects, with a particular focus on enhancing my coding skills. I’m also open to hands-on collaborations in various fields, as long as they involve practical, real-world applications.
